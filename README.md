## 🎯 Goals
- Solve **every single coding challenge**  
- Build all section projects from scratch  
- Write clean, readable, and well-commented code  
- Create a strong public portfolio for job applications

## 🛠️ How to Run the Challenges
Most challenges are pure JavaScript:
1. Open the specific challenge folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use Live Server in VS Code)
3. Open DevTools → Console to see the output

## 💡 Notes
- I avoid `**` operator in early challenges (as requested by the course editor)
- All solutions are 100% my own work (no copying from solutions)
- Feel free to use this repo as inspiration, but try solving challenges yourself first!
